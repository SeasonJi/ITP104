        <p>
          Sometimes a film’s success very much depends on having the right actor in the lead, especially if the film is essentially about that actor. You can’t imagine Being John Malkovich working if Spike Jonze hadn’t persuaded Mr M to take the bait; yes, there are other elegantly eccentric leading men, but Being Jeremy Irons? Being Julian Sands? Hardly the same. Similarly, backstage comedy Birdman – about a faded Hollywood actor once famous for a superhero role – touches a nerve partly because it stars Michael Keaton, whose career declined steadily after Batman Returns (1992). Of course, director Alejandro González Iñárritu might have considered Keaton’s successor in the Batcape, Val Kilmer, but you can’t imagine him being nearly as good; as for the next incumbent of Wayne Manor, George Clooney, playing a shop-soiled also-ran, I somehow doubt we’d have bought that.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first thing you applaud about Birdman is Keaton’s audacity in accepting the role of neurotic Tinseltown veteran Riggan Thomson – and Iñárritu’s chutzpah in offering it to him. The payoff is a considerable comeback for both men. The actor will be unavoidable during the awards season, while the Mexican virtuoso director of Amores Perros fame stages a triumphant return to form after his lugubriously self-important woes-of-the-world drama Beautiful.
        </p>

        <p>
          Birdman, cumbersomely subtitled “Or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance”, is set, and substantially filmed, in and around New York’s St James theatre, where Thomson is attempting to relaunch his career with an earnest stage adaptation of a Raymond Carver story. His co-star is Mike (Edward Norton), a strutting Broadway luminary who soon starts challenging him for control of the show. Also involved are Thomson’s damaged, resentful daughter Sam (Emma Stone); the play’s two female leads (Naomi Watts, Andrea Riseborough); and its harassed producer (a surprisingly muted Zach Galifianakis). And hovering on the sidelines, or at the back of Thomson’s psyche, is his action-movie alter ego Birdman, at first only as a snarling, basso off-screen voice, but later to manifest in his full winged and masked glory.
        </p>

        <p>
          Scripted by Iñárritu with Alexander Dinelaris Jr and Biutiful collaborators Nicolás Giacobone and Armando Bo, Birdman is impartial towards its satirical targets. On one hand it twits the vanities of Hollywood types. Thomson is a deluded bundle of anxieties, bitter about his decline and other actors’ greater success in superhero suits. On the other hand, theatre folk don’t emerge looking any nobler: Mike makes a big song and dance about “wrestling with complex human emotions”, but he’s clearly more interested in wrestling with Thomson’s daughter.

            <br/>Director: Damien Chazelle</br/>
            <br/>Cast: Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, Amiée Conn, J.K. Simmons</br/>
            <br/>Release Date: Dec 9, 2016</br/>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          By the time director Damien Chazelle (Whiplash) winks directly at the audience of his enchanting musical La La Land with a joke about whether people like things that are overtly nostalgic, the audience chuckles knowingly, because the film has already full-throatedly declared its allegiance to the colorful, splashy American musicals of the the '40s and '50s and the French ones of the 1960s.
        </p>

        <p>
          Set in L.A., it tells the story of an aspiring actress (Emma Stone) and a jazz musician (Ryan Gosling) who meet, and sing, and dance, and gaze at each other in beautiful clothes, and if that sounds too simple, it's not: it's utterly intoxicating. It's a movie for people who love darkened theaters, who love movies, who love movie stars, and who love giving themselves over to other people's art without a pause for cynicism.
        </p>

        <p>
          Musicals contain an element of fantasy in their very structure; nobody suddenly breaks out in song in the middle of the day, and if they did, other people in the street would not sing and dance with them. Thus, a musical is an ideal vessel for a story like this that's about creativity and dreaming, one that acknowledges that every relationship has a real existence as well as a fantasy incarnation for which the people in it are constantly reaching. Neither Stone nor Gosling is primarily a song-and-dance person (though she's done Cabaret), but they're both game and ridiculously charismatic, and they're both perfectly capable of what the film asks of them.
        </p>

        <p>
          In order to carry off a film like this, there has to be a total commitment to tonal control, and Chazelle has it nailed. There is an early scene in which Ryan Gosling leans against a lamppost, and it will motivate in even the most cynical of hearts a certain primordial swoon. The people involved in this project know exactly what it is they're making and exactly how they want it to feel. Mary Zophres' costumes are stunning, worth the price of seeing the film on the big screen just for the clothes. Stone spends much of her time in brightly colored solid dresses that are each like the peal of a bell, and Gosling's two-tone shoes are going to help bring back two-tone shoes. (Don't believe me? See the movie.) It's just gorgeous, like a flipbook made of dreamy vintage postcards that are somehow about contemporary life in Los Angeles.

          So last night I got the chance to see the early screening of Christopher Nolan's Interstellar. The film I've been waiting so much from the early days of the shooting. How did it fare? Here's my take:
        </p>

        <p>
          To avoid any tl;dr risk, let me get this straight from the very beginning, Interstellar is one goddamnedly good film, it gets you to the edge of your seat, it soars, it warps, it rips your brain senseless. It's that good.
        </p>

        <p>
          Interstellar is a story about the earth dying, with its soil no longer able to sustain crops other than corn, and of course, it will lead to the extinction of humanity. Our hero is an ex-NASA test pilot named Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a typical ordinary-guy-in-an-extraordinary- situation everyman who's also a dedicated family man, especially toward his daughter Murphy (named after the Murphy's Law). In an all-too-Armageddon style our hero gets invited by the (publicly) defunct NASA to become humanity's last hope in finding a new home, for they have found a wormhole near Saturn (2001, anyone?) which will warp the astronauts to another galaxy in quest of a habitable planet. Solid and compact premise, although it's been used before.
        </p>

        <p>
          For seasoned filmgoers, there are many similar elements (although it's understandable) with Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Robert Zemeckis' Contact (1997). In a sense that this is not a bang-bang-shoot-shoot-blow-em-up sci-fi, but more of a slow-burning, metaphysical sci-fi which gets you to think about your place in the universe and your exact place in time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Similarity with 2001 and Contact is never a bad thing, but it becomes a wee bit too predictable, although Nolan is a smart enough director in providing the final (a very sentimental one, I should say) twist in the story. The visuals in this film is majestic, everything is shot to a meticulously calculated level, Nolan-style. The space scenes are serenely suspenseful just like Cuaron's Gravity, but unlike the documentary feel of Gravity, there's a real gusto and pace to these scenes. You should also be prepared for the (for some, maybe) unexpected third act, it is Nolan's most sentimental and humane moment to date. And this is why Interstellar is more than just a science-fiction, it is a human drama intertwined in space and time loop.
        </p>

        <p>
          One thing that Nolan gets a bit wrong is the narrative. Nolan was never a 'warm' director, his films are filled with brilliant ideas and flair but it feels cold, it maybe suits Memento and The Dark Knight but in Interstellar he seems to have been lost in determining which of the interpersonal drama or the sci-fi that will be Interstellar's forte. The result is a rather incongruous script, intermittently cutting off the excitement of the previous scene and so on. But it is a forgivable sin, for the good is a lot more than the bad in this monumental film. At the end of the day, all I can say is that Interstellar is a grand film. It is monolithic, thoughtful, sentimental, sophisticated, visceral but also with its flaws. I wouldn't say it's Nolan's best work to date, but I daresay that this is one of the best science fiction ever released.

            <br/>Director: Quentin Tarantino</br/>
            <br/>Cast: Brad Pitt, Diane Kruger, Eli Roth</br/>
            <br/>Release Date: Aug 20, 2009</br/>

        </div>

        <p>
          I must admit when I saw the preview for "Inglorious Basterds" I gave myself big expectations. THIS FILM DID NOT Disappoint.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rarely when I watch a movie with such high-expectations do I have those expectations met or exceeded; this film did that and more. Even more rarely do I clap at the end of a movie, this I and everyone else in the theater did.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have to say I am a little biased towards Quentin, I grew up with "Pulp Fiction." I watched it when I was 12 and it is still my favorite and most influential film.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, since then Quentin has not really lived up to his billing. His style was getting a little predictable instead of familiar, the quality honestly wasn't there (I never watched Jackie Brown, and then there's Grindhouse). That is until "Inglorious Basterds." What Quentin did was exactly what was needed for the war genre, a spaghetti western feel that could only be done by Tarantino or Sergio Leone, but seeing how Leone is dead, Tarantino's the self appointed guy on this masterpiece.
        </p>

        <p>
          So let's look at the movie which I won't give away. The writing was spot on, a beautiful transition between using not one but four different languages in this movie. Not to mention this movie was set up in the classic Tarantino mold, great scenes of rich meaningful dialog and sudden shocking action.
        </p>

        <p>
          The acting was superb!! Christopher Waltz deserves an Oscar, seriously. I don't say that often, but honestly the man should get one for this movie, he spoke every language in this movie, and delivered with such amazing touch and poise. He stole the show in a movie that everybody was amazingly impressive.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have no problem building this movie up, because this movie is the best film I've seen all year, and probably all of next year. Quite frankly the more I think about it, this movie may crack my top films of all time, and is Quentin's best movie since "Pulp Fiction." Take it from me, watch this film. I loved it doesn't do this movie enough justice.
        </p>

        <p>
          I watched it yesterday and I'm still blown away. Thank you Quentin from the bottom of my heart for you making this movie. You're back on top again buddy. I can't say enough for "Inglorious Basterds!"
